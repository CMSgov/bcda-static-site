	As promised, BCDA has retrieved the January attribution file and the temporary changes implemented during the end of year have been reset.

	Requests to /Patient and /Group using `all` have returned to their normal state of operation. In addition, you can continue to use /Group with `runout` to retrieve your February runouts data. Please consult the Building Your Application page for guidance on using the runout attribute.
