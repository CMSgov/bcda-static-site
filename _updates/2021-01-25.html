	As promised, BCDA has retrieved the January attribution file and the temporary changes implemented during the end of year have been reset.

	Requests to /Patient and /Group using `all` have returned to their normal state of operation. In addition, you can continue to use /Group with `runout` to retrieve claims runout data for beneficiaries who were attributed to your ACO in 2020 but not in 2021. These claims will have a service date no later than December 31, 2020. Please consult the <a href="build.html#requesting-all-three-EOY" class="in-text__link">Building Your Application page</a> for guidance on using the `runout` attribute.
