      The Beneficiary Claims Data API (BCDA) is excited to announce that we have achieved data parity* with Claim and Claim Line Feed (CCLF) files that you are used to receiving from CMS. Until now, we have been unable to offer about 15 fields that were available in CCLF files, but our upstream data source, the Beneficiary FHIR Data Server (BFD) has successfully mapped these missing fields to BCDAâ€™s payloads.
    </p>
    <p>
      These fields include: CLM_UNCOMPD_CARE_PMT_AMT, EFCTV_BGN_DT, EFCTV_END_DT, and more. We are also removing one data field: BENE_COUNTY_CD.
    </p>
    <p>
      *Note: IDR Load Date Field will not be mapped. This field is generated from a different upstream data warehouse than the one where BCDA sources its claims data.
    </p>
    <p>
      The BCDA Data Dictionary is now updated with all of these mappings. Please see the Data Dictionary or the <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/bc-api/c/cv_-35mFdG8">community announcement</a> in the Google Group for detailed information.
