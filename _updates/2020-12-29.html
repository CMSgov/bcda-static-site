      The production API is undergoing a change that will affect your use of BCDA in the remainder of December 2020 and throughout January 2021. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Why the change?
    </p>
    <p>
      Between December and January, ACOs go through a change in their participant lists and related beneficiary assignment as part of the transition between performance years. BCDA has a delay in receiving the updated beneficiary list in January, so BCDA has been working to ensure that we only return appropriate claims data. Last year, BCDA had to be turned off to address this delay; this year, BCDA is releasing new capabilities to maintain its uptime year-round.
    </p>
    <p>
      BCDA is introducing a new identifier in the /Group endpoint, called `runout`. Between December 2020 and mid-January 2021, this identifier will only return claims with a service date before December 31, 2020. <b>Until BCDA receives January 2021 attribution information, the only way to retrieve claims is to use the group ID `runout` with the /Group endpoint; requests to /Patient or /Group with other group IDs will fail.</b> After BCDA receives January 2021 attribution information, this same `runout` identifier will also be available for ACOs to receive claims runout information from 2020. 
   </p>
