    <p>
    Users may now cancel/delete running jobs by utilizing the DELETE endpoint. The new delete feature will only work on jobs actively running and not in any terminal state (completed, failed, archived, expired, cancelled).
    </p>
    <p>
      Example Request to the new DELETE endpoint
    </p>
    <p>
      DELETE /api/v1/jobs/{jobId}
    </p>
    <p>
      We hope this feature will be useful in cancelling especially long-running jobs. For more details, see the Building Your Application page.
