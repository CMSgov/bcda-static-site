    <p>The BCDA team has updated our guidance for model entities managing their BCDA credentials in 4i and ACO-MS. Please visit <a href="/build.html#bcda-credentials" class="in-text__link">Manage your BCDA Credentials</a> for model specific instructions on how to manage and create BCDA credentials for your organization.</p>
    <p>No action is required for BCDA users, but we hope the updated guidance is helpful!</p>
