      The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is pleased to announce the initial production release of Beneficiary
      Claims Data Application Programming Interface (BCDA) Partially Adjudicated Enhancement on May 16th, 2023. This initial
      release was designed as an expansion of the data available to Medicare providers from the BCDA and is available to
      Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) participating in the ACO Realizing Equity, Access, and Community Health (ACO
      REACH) Model.
    </p>
    <p>
      Access to partially adjudicated claims data reduces the time to access Parts A and B fee-for-service claims to 2-4 days
      after claim submission, while it is typically up to 14 days for fully adjudicated claims data. As ‘partially
      adjudicated’ claims, these claims have entered the Medicare processing system, however, they are not paid or fully
      processed by CMS and may be subject to changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The data is delivered through the Claim and ClaimResponse bulk Fast Health Interoperability (FHIR®) specification
      resource types. Part D (drug coverage) and Durable Medical Equipment (DME) are not included in partially adjudicated
      claims. This enhancement helps to increase care coordination, improve healthcare outcomes, and reduce overall healthcare
      cost for Medicare beneficiaries.
