<p>
	The <a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/bulk-data/export.html#endpoint---all-patients" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="in-text__link"> /Patient endpoint</a> allows you to request resource types for Medicare enrollees assigned or assignable to your model entity. For adjudicated claims, this includes ExplanationOfBenefit, Patient, and/or Coverage. For partially adjudicated claims, this includes Claim and ClaimResponse (REACH ACOs only). 
</p>

<p>
	However, this does not allow requests for data patient-by-patient. By the Bulk FHIR specification, only data for all patients associated with the authorized usersâ€™ credentials can be returned. 
</p>

<p>
	You may also use the <a href="https://bcda.cms.gov/guide.html#since-parameter" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="in-text__link">_since parameter</a> to filter for claims last updated after a specified date. If no filter is applied, BCDA will return data as far back as 2014.
