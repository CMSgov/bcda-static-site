<p>
	The <a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/us-bulk-data/#endpoint---all-patients" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="in-text__link"> /Patient endpoint</a> allows you to request ExplanationOfBenefit, Patient, and/or Coverage data for all beneficiaries assigned or assignable to your ACO.
</p>

<p>
	Note that the /Patient endpoint does not allow requests for data patient-by-patient. By the Bulk FHIR specification, only data for all patients associated with the authorized usersâ€™ credentials can be returned.
</p>

<p>
	You may also filter data by date using the _since parameter. If no filter is applied, a request to the /Patient endpoint in BCDA returns seven years of historical data for all assigned and assignable beneficiaries.
