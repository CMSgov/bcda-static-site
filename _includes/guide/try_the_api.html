<p>
	To get you started with the BCDA API, we have provided the bare minimum steps to access data in the sandbox! Using the four cURL commands below, you should be able to walk through the standard process of retrieving data from the API.
</p>
<p>
	Please follow along this short demo in your Terminal window or through an application such as Postman.
</p>
<p>
	For far more detail for each of these steps and for retrieving production data, see the <a href=/build.html target="_blank"> Building Your Application</a> page.
