      <h3 class="ds-c-alert__heading">Temporary Change to Production Requests</h3>
      <p class="ds-c-alert__text">
		During January 2021, production users have to change how they request data. Requests must be sent to the /Group endpoint and must include a new identifier: "runouts". All the claims returned will have a service date of 12/31/2020 or earlier. Any requests to the /Group (without the "runouts" identifier) or /Patient endpoints will fail and  result in an error message. 
	</p>
	<p>
		These changes are in place to ensure that BCDA does not return any data not assigned to your organization during the transition between performance years. Please see the full details in the <a href="#requesting-data-EOY">End of Year Requests</a> section on the Building Your API page.

<p>
	The <a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/us-bulk-data/#endpoint---group-of-patients" target="_blank"> /Group endpoint</a> allows you to request ExplanationOfBenefit, Patient, and/or Coverage data for all beneficiaries assigned or assignable to your ACO.  You must supply a group parameter. The only supported parameter currently is ‘all’. 
</p>
<p>
	You may also filter data by date using the _since parameter. If no filter is applied, a request to the /Group endpoint in BCDA returns seven years of historical data for all assigned and assignable beneficiaries.
