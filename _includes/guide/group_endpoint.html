	The /Group endpoint allows you to request ExplanationOfBenefit, Patient, and/or Coverage data for all beneficiaries assigned or assignable to your ACO.  You must supply a group parameter. The only supported parameter currently is ‘all’.

<p>
	You may also filter data by date using the _since parameter. If no filter is applied, a request to the /Group endpoint in BCDA returns seven years of historical data for all assigned and assignable beneficiaries.
