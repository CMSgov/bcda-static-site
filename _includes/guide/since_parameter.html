	The _since parameter allows you to apply a date parameter to your bulk data requests. Instead of receiving the full record of historical data every time you request data from an endpoint, you will be able to use _since to submit a date. The API will then produce claims data from the bulk data endpoints that have been loaded since the entered date.
