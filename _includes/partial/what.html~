  <p>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is pleased to announce the upcoming production release of Beneficiary Claims Data Application Programming Interface (BCDA) Partially Adjudicated Enhancement on May 16th, 2023. This initial release expands the data available to Medicare providers from BCDA. It is available to Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) participating in the ACO Realizing Equity, Access, and Community Health (ACO REACH) Model.
  </p>
  <p>Access to partially adjudicated claims data reduces the time to access Parts A and B fee-for-service claims to 2-4 days after claim submission. It typically takes up to 14 days for adjudicated claims data. As ‘partially adjudicated’ claims, these claims have entered the Medicare processing system, but are not paid or fully processed by CMS and may be subject to changes. This enhancement can be used to increase care coordination, improve healthcare outcomes, and reduce healthcare costs for Medicare beneficiaries.
