  <p>Answer: The BCDA Partially Adjudicated Claims data can be used to increase care coordination, improve healthcare outcomes, and reduce overall healthcare cost for enrollees. It does this by reducing the time to access Parts A and B Fee-for-Service (FFS) claims from typically up to 14 days for adjudicated claims, to 2-4 days using partially adjudicated claims data. Partially adjudicated claims are claims that have entered the Medicare processing system but are not fully paid or processed by CMS. Part D (drug related) and Durable Medical Equipment (DME) are not included in partially adjudicated claims. The BCDA Partially Adjudicated Claims data is accessible through BCDA. This capability is available to Realizing Equity, Access, and Community Health (REACH) Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs). The initial release provides these REACH ACOs with an opportunity to streamline their clinical care processes. REACH ACOs with BCDA credentials who access BCDA V2 will, by default, also retrieve partially adjudicated claims through the Claim and ClaimResponse resource types.
