<p>In order to aid in users' understanding of BCDA file data and structure, BCDA provides sample Explanation of Benefit, Patient, and Coverage FHIR resource files to download. These files contain synthetic data, but the structure and contents of the files are similar to the actual files you will be pulling and downloading from the BCDA production environment. These files contain data for only 100 synthetic beneficiaries. Please visit the <a href="/guide.html" class="in-text__link">Getting Started</a> page for a more in-depth look at the synthetic data options available to you through the BCDA Sandbox environment.</p>
