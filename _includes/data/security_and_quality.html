    The Beneficiary Claims Data API (BCDA) serves data according to the bulk
    FHIR specification using three FHIR resources: Explanation of Benefit
    (EOB), Patient, and Coverage. This means that your claims data will be
    delivered through three FHIR resource types rather than 12 CCLF files.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      The <strong>Explanation of Benefit</strong> (EOB) resource type provides
      similar information to what was previously provided in CCLF files 1-7.
      The EOB files contain lines within an episode of care, including where
      and when the service was performed, the diagnosis codes, the provider who
      performed the service, and the cost of care.
    </li>

    <li>
      The <strong>Patient</strong> resource type can be thought of as your CCLF files 8
      and 9. This is where you get your information about who your
      beneficiaries are, their demographic information, and updates to their
      patient identifiers.
    </li>

    <li>
      The <strong>Coverage</strong> resource type provides information about 
      beneficiariesâ€™ insurance coverage, including information about dual
      coverage.
    </li>
  </ul>
 
  <p> 
    Beneficiary claims data may be updated for a variety of reasons; from a
    beneficiary disputing a claim, to a claim being adjusted by the healthcare
    provider. BCDA receives updates to claims weekly, while CCLF receives them
    monthly. Since BCDA and CCLF receive updates to claims at different
    intervals, one will almost always be more current than the other. Any
    discrepancies you may encounter when using BCDA data to supplement CCLF
    data should resolve themselves by the following month.
  </p>

  <p>
    CMS provides Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) with beneficiary
    identifiable claims data for preliminarily prospectively and prospectively
    assigned beneficiaries and other beneficiaries who receive primary care
    services from an ACO. This data may be used to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Redesigning care processes and coordination of care for ACOs beneficiary
      populations
    </li>

    <li>
      Enabling practitioners in an ACO to better coordinate and target care
      strategies toward individual beneficiaries
    </li>

    <li>
      Evaluating the performance of its ACO participants or its ACO
      providers/suppliers
    </li>

    <li>
      Conducting quality assessment and improvement activities
    </li>

    <li>
      Conducting population-based activities relating to improved health
    </li>
  </ul>
