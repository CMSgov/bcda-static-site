    The CCLF to BCDA Data Dictionary is provided to BCDA users to facilitate their data mapping process. Because BCDA delivers data in the FHIR format, data field names will be different from previous data fields delivered through CCLFs. In this spreadsheet, BCDA has provided a crosswalk between all CCLF data fields and their new locations within BCDA Claims files*. The Data Dictionary also provides supplementary context for each of the CCLF/BCDA data fields, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Claim Field Names and Descriptions</li>
    <li>Start/End Position</li>
    <li>Data Type</li>
    <li>Length/li>
    <li>Format</li>
    <li>PII/PHI</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For the appropriate beneficiaries, the data provided to the ACO through BCDA includes claims for all services covered by Part A (Hospital Insurance) and Part B (Supplemental Medical Insurance) that were provided and processed during the prior month. Claims data also include prescriptions covered by a Part D Prescription Drug Program in which the beneficiary is enrolled. ACOs will be able to retrieve both the CCLF and BCDA claims data concurrently for the foreseeable future; we encourage our users to use both the CCLF and BCDA data sources to compare and contrast the data that is being delivered to your ACO. BCDA Engineers have designed the API to deliver the same claims data as is contained in the CCLFs.</p>

The Beneficiary FHIR Data Server (BFD) API team is working hard to map all of the CCLF fields in the near future. The fields that have not been mapped yet are shaded in grey. Other fields will also not be mapped to BCDA. Additional information for unmapped fields can be found in the notes column of the BCDA Data Dictionary.</p>
