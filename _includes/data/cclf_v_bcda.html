  <p>Beneficiary claims data may be updated for a variety of reasons; from a beneficiary disputing a claim, to a claim being adjusted by the healthcare provider. Updates to claims are typically applied to CCLF datastores on a monthly basis, resulting in Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) relying on older data towards the end of the month. Data served by the Beneficiary Claims Data API (BCDA) is updated weekly, providing ACOs the ability to make data-driven decisions with more relevant and current data.</p>
  <p>Since CCLF data and BCDA data are updated at different frequencies, you may find discrepancies when trying to compare the two. These discrepancies are to be expected, and should not affect your ability to use CCLF or BCDA data in your day-to-day operations.</p>
  <p>BCDA serves data according to the bulk FHIR specification using three FHIR resources: Explanation of Benefit (EOB), Patient, and Coverage. This means that your claims data will be delivered through three FHIR resource types rather than 12 CCLF files.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The <b>Explanation of Benefit</b> resource type provides information you’ve previously received in CCLF files 1-7. The EOB files contain the lines within an episode of care, including where and when the service was performed, the diagnosis codes, the provider who performed the service, and the cost of care.</li>
    <li>The <b>Patient</b> resource type can be thought of as your CCLF files 8 and 9: this is where you get your information about who your beneficiaries are, their demographic information, and updates to their patient identifiers.</li>
    <li>The <b>Coverage</b> resource type provides information about the beneficiaries’ insurance coverage, including information about dual coverage.</li>
  </ul>
