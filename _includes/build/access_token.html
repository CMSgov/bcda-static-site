	Currently, access tokens expire after twenty minutes. To illustrate this cycle, we’ll use the published open sandbox credentials for Extra-Small Model Entities.
</p>

<pre><code><b>Example Client ID (Extra-Small Model Entities):</b>

<h3>
	Submit your credentials to receive an Access Token
</h3>
<p>
	You will need to submit the Client ID and the Client Secret issued to your organization using a POST request. You will receive an Access Token that allows access to the API for 20 minutes before expiring.
</p>

<h4>
	Access Token Request
</h4>
<pre><code>POST /auth/token</code></pre>

<h4>
	Access Token cURL Command
</h4>
	<p>
		cURL Option 1: This cURL command requires separate base-64 encryption. We have concatenated the base64 encoding of the ‘Client ID : Secret’ as the argument to the -H flag. Please note that the URL in the Production environment will be different. 
	</p>
<pre><code>curl -d '' -X POST 'https://api.bcda.cms.gov/auth/token' \
	-H "accept: application/json" \
	-H "authorization: Basic Mzg0MWM1OTQtYThjMC00MWU1Tk4Y2MtMzhiYjQ1MzYwZDNjOmY5NzgwZDMyMzU4OGYxY2RmYzNlNjNlOTVhOGNiZGNkZDQ3NjAyZmY0OGE1MzdiNTFkYzVkNzgzNGJmNDY2NDE2YTcxNmJkNDUwOGU5MDRh"</code></pre>

<p>
	cURL Option 2: This cURL command encrypts your credentials with base-64 encryption
</p>
<pre><code>curl -d '' -X POST 'https://api.bcda.cms.gov/auth/token' \
	--user 3841c594-a8c0-41e5-98cc-38bb45360d3c:f9780d323588f1cdfc3e63e95a8cbdcdd47602ff48a537b51dc5d7834bf466416a716bd4508e904a \

<h4>
	Access Token Response Example
</h4>
<p>
	The token string below has been abbreviated for readability.
</p>
<pre><code>{
"access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzUxMiIsInR5c...",
"token_type":"bearer"
}</code></pre>


<h4>
	Access Token Response Headers
</h4>
<p>access_token: The full text string will serve as your access token.
token_type: A fixed value as “bearer”.</p>

<h4>
	Access Token Explanation
</h4>
<p>In cURL Option 1, you must base-64 encode the Client ID and Secret. Once that is performed, the encoded credentials can be passed to cURL as a header with the form: authorization: Basic [base64-encoded clientId:secret]</p>
<p>In cURL Option 2, the user can take advantage of cURL’s built-in ability to base-64 encode the clientId and secret, and request and receive their token in a single step.
If your operation succeeds, you will receive a 202 response with your access token as a header. You will receive a 401 Unauthorized response if your credentials are invalid or if your token has expired. No additional information is returned with a 401 response. When you receive a 401 response for a token you were just using successfully, you should request a new access token as outlined above.</p>

<h2>
	Set your Access Token as a Bearer Token
</h2>
<p>
	In all of your requests, set your access token as the Bearer token. The Bearer token is included in the header of any requests as follows:
</p>
<pre><code>Authorization: Bearer <span style="color: #046B99;">{access_token}</span></code></pre>
<p>
	Notice that the word “Bearer” must be included with a capital B and followed by a space.
</p>
