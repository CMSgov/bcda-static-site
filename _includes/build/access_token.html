<h4>
	Access Token Response Example
</h4>
<p>
	The token string below has been abbreviated for readability.
</p>
<code>
	{
  “access_token”: “eyJhbGciOiJSUzUxMiIsInR5c ....”,
  ”token_type”:“bearer”
}
</code>


<h4>
	Access Token Response Headers
</h4>
<p>access_token: The full text string will serve as your access token.
token_type: A fixed value as “bearer”.</p>

<h4>
	Access Token Explanation
</h4>
<p>In cURL Option 1, you must base-64 encode the clientId and secret. Once that is performed, the encoded credentials can be passed to cURL as a header with the form: authorization: Basic [base64-encoded clientId:secret]
In cURL Option 2, the user can take advantage of cURL’s built-in ability to base-64 encode the clientId and secret, and request and receive their token in a single step.
If your operation succeeds, you will receive a 202 response with your access token as a header. You will receive a 401 Unauthorized response if your credentials are invalid or if your token has expired. No additional information is returned with a 401 response. When you receive a 401 response for a token you were just using successfully, you should request a new access token as outlined above.</p>

<h2>
	Set your Access Token as a Bearer Token
</h2>
<p>
	In all of your requests, set your access token as the Bearer token. The Bearer token is included in the header of any requests as follows:
</p>
<code>
	Authorization: Bearer {token}
</code>
<p>
	Notice that the word “Bearer” must be included with a capital B and followed by a space.
