<p>
For each request and operation, we provide example requests and example cURL commands. We will highlight any common errors or unique attributes of our API. Lastly, we provide an example response from the API.
<p>This documentation is for the production environment (api.bcda.cms.gov). To access this API, your organization must <a href="#authorization">obtain production credentials</a> and add its IP address. If you do not have credentials, you can access synthetic data using the sandbox environment (sandbox.bcda.cms.gov). After adding IP addresses to 4i / ACO-MS, it may take up to an hour for the IPs to be added to the allow list.</p>
