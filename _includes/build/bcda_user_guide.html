For each request and operation, we provide example requests and example cURL commands. We will highlight any common errors or unique attributes of our API. Lastly, we will provide an example response from the API.

      <p class="ds-c-alert__text">
	Throughout January 2021, users will need to use the `runout` identifier with the /Group endpoint <b>in order to request any claims from BCDA's production environment</b>. Requests to the /Group and /Patient endpoints without the `runout` identifier will result in an error message. When using the `runout` identifier, data returned by the API will be restricted to claims with a service date of 12/31/2020 or earlier.  
</p>
<p>
	These changes are in place to ensure that BCDA does not return any data not assigned to your organization during the transition between performance years. Please see the full details in the <a href="#requesting-data-EOY">End of Year Requests</a> section below.
