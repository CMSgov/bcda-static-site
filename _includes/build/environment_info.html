The following examples point to the production instance of BCDA (api.bcda.cms.gov). If you have not yet obtained production credentials and added your organization's IP address to the allow list, requests will not be completed. Until your organization's credentials have been added, please use the sandbox environment (sandbox.bcda.cms.gov). After adding your organization's IP address to the allow list, it may take up to an hour for you to be able to connect.
