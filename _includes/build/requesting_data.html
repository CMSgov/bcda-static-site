      <h3 class="ds-c-alert__heading">Temporary Change to Production Requests</h3>
      <p class="ds-c-alert__text">
	Throughout January 2021, users will need to use the `runout` identifier with the /Group endpoint <b>in order to request any claims from BCDA's production environment</b>. Requests to the /Group and /Patient endpoints without the `runout` identifier will result in an error message. When using the `runout` identifier, data returned by the API will be restricted to claims with a service date of 12/31/2020 or earlier. 
</p>
<p>
	These changes are in place to ensure that BCDA does not return any data not assigned to your organization during the transition between performance years. Please see the full details in the <a href="#requesting-all-three-EOY">End of Year Requests</a> section above.
</p>
   </div>
</div>

<p>
	To obtain all the available data (up to 7 years) for all of your beneficiaries, you can make a request to either the /Patient or /Group endpoint. You may want to do this as a first call, as a way to check for BCDA files against CCLF, or to create a database.
</p>
<p>
	BCDA data will be updated weekly, so you will be able to make requests and expect to retrieve new data on a weekly basis.
</p>

<h2>List of Requests</h2>
<p>You can make a few different unfiltered requests for data:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Request all three Resource Types at once</li>
	<li>Request any two Resource Types</li>
	<li>Request a single Resource Type</li>
</ol>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<p>
	Each request will follow the same four step process:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Obtain an access token</li>
	<li>Start a job to acquire data</li>
	<li>Check the job status</li>
	<li>Download the data</li>
</ol>
