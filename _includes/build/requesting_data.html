<p>
	To obtain all the available data (as far back as 2014) for all of your beneficiaries, you can make a request to either the /Patient or /Group endpoint. You may want to do this as a first call, as a way to check for BCDA files against CCLF files, or to create a database.
</p>
<p>
	BCDA data will be updated weekly, so you will be able to make requests and expect to retrieve new data on a weekly basis.
</p>

<h2>List of Requests</h2>
<p>You can make a few different unfiltered requests for data:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Request all three Resource Types at once</li>
	<li>Request any two Resource Types</li>
	<li>Request a single Resource Type</li>
</ol>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<p>
	Each request will follow the same four step process:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Obtain an access token</li>
	<li>Start a job to acquire data</li>
	<li>Check the job status</li>
	<li>Download the data</li>
</ol>
