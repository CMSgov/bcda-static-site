<h3>Step 2: Send a Request to the Jobs Endpoint</h3>

<h4>Requests to retrieve data on all past jobs</h4>  
<pre><code>GET /api/v1/jobs</code></pre>

<h4>Request Headers</h4>
<pre><code>Authorization: Bearer <span style="color: #046B99;">{access_token}</span>
Accept: application/fhir+json
Prefer: respond-async</code></pre>

<h4>cURL Command to check the job status</h4>
<pre><code>curl -X GET 'https://api.bcda.cms.gov/api/v1/jobs' \
    -H "accept: application/fhir+json" \
    -H "Prefer: respond-async" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <span style="color: #046B99;">{access_token}</span>"</code></pre>

<h4>Response Example: Completed Job</h4>

<h4>Retrieve Historical Data on Past Job Requests Explanation</h4>
<p>
    This operation will return a Bundle of resources containing information about jobs sent by your organization historically. Each resource represents a single job request. Notice that each resource contains a start date/time, an end date/time, a unique identifier, and the original request (contained in valueString).
</p>

<p>
    Your jobs in the BCDA system have nine possible end states: Completed, Archived, Expired, Failed, FailedExpired, In Progress, Pending, Cancelled, and CancelledExpired. Notice that, in the above example, we did not supply any parameters; we’ve made an unfiltered request for all past jobs. To filter by the status of the job, you may supply a ‘status’ parameter. However, the status parameter has only four possible values supported by the FHIR Task resource: Completed, Failed, In Progress, and Cancelled.
</p>

<p>
    The nine possible job states map to the four supported FHIR Task status values as follows:

    <ul>
        <li>Archived, Expired, Completed -> Completed</li>
        <li>FailedExpired, Failed -> Failed</li>
        <li>Pending, In Progress -> In Progress</li>
        <li>CancelledExpired, Cancelled-> Cancelled</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    For example, if your organization had jobs Archived in the BCDA system, you could make a filtered request for those as follows: <code>GET /api/v1/Jobs?_status=Archived</code>. You would receive a list of jobs with the status “Completed”. All of these jobs were Archived in the BCDA system. If your organization also had jobs with the end state of Expired or Completed in the BCDA system, they would also hold the status of Completed. But, they would not be returned in your request for Archived jobs.
</p>

<p>
    If your organization has no jobs to return, you will receive a 404 ERROR in your response.
