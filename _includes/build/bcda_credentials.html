<h3 id="create-credentials">Create your credentials</h3>
<p>BCDA credentials are formatted as a client ID and secret, which your organization will use every time it makes an API request and exports data. Production credentials are <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opcl/privacy-act-1974">Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</a> that must be stored securely. </p>
<p>Create BCDA credentials by visiting the <em>API Credentials</em> page in your model-specific system. Choose the <em>BCDA Credentials</em> tab, then select <em>Create New API Credentials</em>. You'll need to provide a public, static IP address for every system, including vendors, that will access the API (up to 8 IP addresses). It may take up to an hour for the allow list to be updated. </p>

<h3 id="rotate-credentials">Rotate your credentials</h3>
<p>Your organization's credentials will expire and deactivate after a set period of time. You can rotate BCDA credentials in the <em>API Credentials</em> page to generate a new, active client ID and secret. </p>
<p>You'll need to rotate credentials every <strong>90 days</strong> in 4i or every <strong>12 months</strong> in ACO-MS. Once you choose the <em>BCDA Credentials</em> tab, select the rotate icon under the <em>Actions</em> column. </p>

<h3 id="revoke-credentials">Revoke your credentials</h3>
<p>You may need to revoke (deactivate) your organization's credentials if they are leaked or compromised. You can create new credentials as a replacement afterward. </p>
<p>Revoke BCDA credentials in the <em>API Credentials</em> page. Choose the <em>BCDA Credentials</em> tab, then select the delete (x) icon under the <em>Actions</em> column. </p>

<h3 id="credentials-compromised">If your credentials have been compromised</h3>
<p>Please revoke or rotate your BCDA credentials immediately. Afterward, notify the BCDA team at <a href="mailto:bcapi@cms.hhs.gov">bcapi@cms.hhs.gov</a> to review recent activity. </p>
