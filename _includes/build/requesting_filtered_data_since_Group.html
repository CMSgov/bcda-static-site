<h3>Request recent data for current beneficiaries AND all historical data for newly attributed beneficiaries</h3>

<h3>Step 1: Obtain an Access Token</h3>
	<p>
		See <a href="https://bcda.cms.gov/production/technical-user-guide/#authentication-and-authorization">Authentication and Authorization</a> above.
	</p>



<h3>Step 2: Start a job</h3>

<h4>Request to Start a job using the _since parameter with the /Group endpoint</h4>
	<code>
		<p>GET /api/v1/Group/all/$export?_type=Patient&_since=2020-02-13T08:00:00.000-05:00</p>
	</code>

<h4>Request Headers</h4>
	<code>
		<ul>
			<li>Authorization: Bearer {token}</li>
			<li>Accept: application/fhir+json</li>
			<li>Prefer: respond-asnc</li>
		</ul>
	</code>

<h4>cURL Command using the _since parameter with the /Group endpoint</h4>
	<code>
		<p>curl -X GET "https://api.bcda.cms.gov/api/v1/Group/all/$export?_type=Patient&_since=2020-02-13T08:00:00.000-05:00</p>
		<p>-H 'Authorization: Bearer {token}' \</p>
		<p>-H 'Accept: application/fhir+json' \</p>
		<p>-H 'Prefer: respond-async'</p>
	</code>

<h4>Response Example</h4>
	<code>
		<p>
		EMPTY_BODY

<h4>Response Headers</h4>
	<code>
		<p>Content-Location: https://api.bcda.cms.gov/api/v1/jobs/42</p>
	</code>


<h4>Start a Job using _since with /Group Explanation</h4>
	<p>
		This operation will start a job for filtered data for existing beneficiaries since 8PM EST on February 13th, 2020 and all data for newly assigned beneficiaries that month. Notice that a GET 	request is made to the /Group endpoint. This request would behave differently if it was made from the /Patient endpoint. In the example, we request the Patient resource type. The steps and form	at 	would work similarly for other resource types.
	</p>	
	<p>
		You must provide the groupID of "all" as well a	s a _since date in the FHIR format. An access token as well as Accept and Prefer headers are required. The dollar sign ($) before the word 	"export" in the URL indicates that the endpoint is	 an action rather than a resource. The format is defined by the FHIR Bulk Data Export spec.
	</p>	
	<p>
		If the request was successful, a 202 Accepted r	esponse code will be returned and the response will include a Content-Location header. The valu	e of this header indicates the location to c	heck 	for job status and outcome. In the example header 	below, the number 48 in the URL represents the ID of the export job.

    	    <p class="ds-c-alert__text">
    	      Note: While most claims data is updated on a weekly cadence (and we encourage you to retrieve your ACO's claims data weekly), ACO attribution is only updated one time per month, so you will only be able to retrieve historical claims data for newly attributed beneficiaries once per month. Additional calls will only yield duplicative data for these newly attributed beneficiaries.
