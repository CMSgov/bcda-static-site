      <h3 class="ds-c-alert__heading">Temporary Change to Production Requests</h3>
      <p class="ds-c-alert__text">
	During January 2021, production users have to change how they request data. Requests must be sent to the /Group endpoint and must include a new identifier: "runouts". All the claims returned will have a service date of 12/31/2020 or earlier. Any requests to the /Group (without the "runouts" identifier) or /Patient endpoints will fail and  result in an error message. 
</p>
<p>
	These changes are in place to ensure that BCDA does not return any data not assigned to your organization during the transition between performance years. Please see the full details in the <a href="#requesting-data-EOY">End of Year Requests</a> section below.
</p>
   </div>
</div>

<p>
	To obtain any data for your beneficiaries during January 2021, you must make a request to the /Group endpoint with the "runout" identifier. You may want to do this to retrieve data during the end of year reassignment period or simply to retrieve your runouts files. The claims returned when using "runout" will be filtered by their serviceData. You will not receive any claim with a service date of 12/31/20 or before.
</p>

<h2>When will these changes end?</h2>
<p>
	We expect these changes to be in effect until BCDA retrieves the January 2021 attribution file from CMS. This should be no later than January 31, 2021. After this time, requests to /Patient and /Group using `all` will return to their normal state of operation. In addition, you can continue to use /Group with `runout` to retrieve your February runouts data. BCDA will update the Google Group when you can begin using `all` again.
</p>

<h2>What changes does my ACO need to make?</h2>
<h3>In January 2021:</h3>

<ol>
	<li>To request any claims, users will need to use the `runout` identifier with the /Group endpoint.</li>
	<li>Requests to the /Group and /Patient endpoints without the `runout` identifier will result in an error message.</li>
	<li>When using the `runout` identifier, data returned by the API will be restricted to claims with a service date of 12/31/2020 or earlier.</li>
</ol>
 
<h3>Between February and April 2021:</h3> 
<ol>
	<li>Requests to the /Group and /Patient endpoints can again use the `all` identifier, as normal and will return claims with a service date in 2021.</li>
	<li>To request runouts data, users can also make a call using the `runout` identifier with the /Group endpoint.</li>
	<li>When using the `runout` identifier, data returned by the API will be restricted to claims with a service date of 12/31/2020 or earlier.</li>
</ol>


<h2>List of Requests</h2>
<p>During January, you can make a few different unfiltered requests for data, all of them must be to the /Group endpoint and include the 'runout
 identifier:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Request all three Resource Types at once</li>
	<li>Request any two Resource Types</li>
	<li>Request a single Resource Type</li>
</ol>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<p>
	Each request will follow the same four step process:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Obtain an access token</li>
	<li>Start a job to acquire data</li>
	<li>Check the job status</li>
	<li>Download the data</li>
</ol>
