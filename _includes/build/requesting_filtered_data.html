    	      Note: Before using _since for the first time, we recommend that you run an unfiltered request (without using _since) to all resource types on the /Patient endpoint in order to retrieve all historical data for your ACO's associated beneficiaries. You only need to do this once. On subsequent calls you can begin retrieving incremental claims data for your beneficiaries using _since. Use the transactionTime from your last bulk data request set as the _since date.

    	</div>

<p>
	You may want to obtain filtered data for all of your beneficiaries or for a subset of your beneficiaries in order to reduce file size and download time. You can make a request using the _since parameter to either the /Patient or /Group endpoints, but be wary that you understand the difference regarding new beneficiaries. You may want to do this as a repeating call or as a way to check for new data.
</p>

<h3>List of Requests</h3>
	<p>
		You can make a few different filtered requests for data:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Request the most recent data for all beneficiaries</li>
		<li>Use _since within the /Patient endpoint</li>
		<li>Request the most recent data for all beneficiaries AND historical data for newly added beneficiaries</li>
		<li>Use _since within the /Group endpoint</li>
	</ol>

<h3>Steps</h3>
	<p>
		Each request will follow the same four step process as an unfiltered request:
	</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Obtain an access token</li>
			<li>Start a job to acquire data</li>
			<li>Check the job status</li>
			<li>Download the data</li>
		</ol>
	<p>
		The only difference appears in the request of Step 2: Start a job to acquire data.
	</p>


<h2>Using the _since parameter</h2>

<h3>Format dates and times by the FHIR standard</h3>
	<p>
	Dates and times submitted in _since must be listed in the FHIR instant format (YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:sss+zz:zz).
	</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Sample Date: February 20, 2020 12:00 PM EST</li>
			<li>instant Format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:sss+zz:zz</li>
			<li>Formatted Sample: 2020-02-20T12:00:00.000-05:00</li>
		</ul>

	</p>

<h3>Be wary of requesting data from before 02-12-2020</h3>
	<p>
		Due to limitations in the Beneficiary FHIR Data (BFD) Server, data from before 02-12-2020 is marked with the arbitrary <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html#lastUpdated">lastUpdated</a> date of 01-01-2020. If you input dates between 01-01-2020 and 02-11-2020 in the _since parameter, you will receive all historical data for your beneficiaries. Data loads from 02-12-2020 onwards have been marked with accurate dates.
