	You may want to obtain filtered data for all of your beneficiaries (or for a subset of your beneficiaries) in order to reduce file size and download time. You may also want to target specific data, such as your runouts data.
</p>
<p>
	To reduce file size, use the _since parameter with either the /Patient or /Group endpoints, but be wary that you understand the difference regarding newly added beneficiaries. You may want to do this as a repeating call or as a way to check for new data.
</p>
<p>
	To obtain claims runout data, use the <a href="#requesting-data-runouts" class="in-text__link">'runout' parameter with the /Group endpoint</a>, which returns data for beneficiaries who were attributed to your ACO the previous year but not the current year. These claims will have a service date no later than December 31 of the previous year.

    	      <p>
    	      	Before using _since for the first time, we recommend that you run an unfiltered request (without using _since) to all resource types on the /Patient or /Group endpoints in order to retrieve all historical data for your ACO's associated beneficiaries. You only need to do this once.
    	      </p>
    	      <p>
    	      On subsequent calls you can begin retrieving incremental claims data for your beneficiaries using _since. We suggest using the transactionTime from your last bulk data request as the _since date.
    	      </p>

<h2>List of Requests</h2>
	<p>
		You can make a few different filtered requests for data:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Request the most recent data for all beneficiaries: <a href="#requesting-since-with-Patient" class="in-text__link">Use _since within the /Patient endpoint</a></li>
		<li>Request the most recent data for all beneficiaries AND historical data for newly added beneficiaries: <a href="#requesting-since-with-Group" class="in-text__link">Use _since within the /Group endpoint</a></li>
		<li>Request runouts data: <a href="#requesting-data-runouts" class="in-text__link">Use 'runout' within the /Group endpoint</a></li>
	</ol>

<h2>Steps</h2>
	<p>
		Each request will follow the same four step process as an unfiltered request:
	</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Obtain an access token</li>
			<li>Start a job to acquire data (you will input the _since parameter here)</li>
			<li>Check the job status</li>
			<li>Download the data</li>
		</ol>
	<p>
		The only difference appears in the request of Step 2: Start a job to acquire data. We show examples of this step below.
	</p>




<h2>When using _since, format dates and times by the FHIR standard</h2>
	<p>
	Dates and times submitted in _since must be listed in the FHIR instant format (YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:sss+zz:zz).
	</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Sample Date: February 20, 2020 12:00 PM EST</li>
			<li>instant Format: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:sss+zz:zz</li>
			<li>Formatted Sample: 2020-02-20T12:00:00.000-05:00</li>
		</ul>

		Due to limitations in the Beneficiary FHIR Data (BFD) Server, data from before 02-12-2020 is marked with the arbitrary <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html#lastUpdated" class="in-text__link">lastUpdated</a> date of 01-01-2020. If you input dates between 01-01-2020 and 02-11-2020 in the _since parameter, you will receive all historical data for your beneficiaries. Data loads from 02-12-2020 onwards have been marked with accurate dates.
