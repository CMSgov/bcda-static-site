# {{ page.page_title }}

The Beneficiary Claims Data API (BCDA) team is excited to kick off our version 3 (v3) Early Adopter Program. As an early adopter you’ll be one of the first to interact with v3. You’ll share feedback that can shape the future of BCDA and get personalized support.   

## How does the Early Adopter Program work?

1. We’ll start with a scheduled kick-off call.
2. Every 2 weeks you’ll complete 1 of 5 total test scenarios. 
3. You’ll join scheduled office hours to share feedback and ask questions about each test scenario. 
4. We’ll record and share office hours sessions for reference. Those who can’t attend will complete a short survey to share their feedback on the test scenario.

## How do I get started?

The Early Adopter Program starts with a kick-off call. Before the kick off call (or throughout the program) you can:

- Learn about BCDA
- Review API documentation 
- Explore [Introducing BCDA v3]({{ '/v3/introducing-v3.html' | relative_url }}) <span class="usa-tag margin-x-1 bg-accent-warm">New</span>
- Review [How to Migrate to v3]({{ '/v3/api-documentation/how-to-migrate-v3.html' | relative_url }}) <span class="usa-tag margin-x-1 bg-accent-warm">New</span>

Need help? Contact us at <a href="mailto:bcapi@cms.hhs.gov">bcapi@cms.hhs.gov</a> if you’re missing invites to the kick-off or office hours, or if you have general questions.

We look forward to joining you in what we hope will be a fun and enlightening program.
