## What is Connectathon?

On July 15-17 2025, healthcare organizations, vendors, and payers will gather for hands-on testing of FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) applications in a live environment.

## Join BCDA on July 16

We’ll be hosting a [BCDA Connectathon session](https://confluence.hl7.org/spaces/FHIR/pages/345083176/2025+-+07+Bulk+FHIR+Implementation+with+BCDA) (track) in which participants can be the first to preview v3. You’ll test connections to demo endpoints in our sandbox. We hope you’ll learn something and provide feedback on proposed v3 enhancements including:
- Making it easier to trace claims across the adjudication process
- Better conformance with the latest implementation guides
- Representing extensions and CMS-specific codings as FHIR resources

View the [full schedule](https://whova.com/embedded/event/fHtR%40l-Bup5chLVjyDOQYOk14iQ2VTEtfnNEH%40EnYek%3D/) and register for the [Connectathon](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/B9v3CMC) by June 30.

Find additional details about this session in the [Bulk FHIR Implementation with BCDA](https://confluence.hl7.org/spaces/FHIR/pages/345083176/2025+-+07+Bulk+FHIR+Implementation+with+BCDA) track description, and join the conversation with other members of the larger FHIR community in the [#bulk data > CMS Connectathon BCDA Bulk Track](https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/channel/179250-bulk-data/topic/CMS.20Connectathon.20BCDA.20Bulk.20Track/with/517153119) thread (Zulip "topic").

## Don’t miss CMS Blue Button

[Blue Button 2.0 (BB2.0)](https://bluebutton.cms.gov/), another API within the CMS family, will host its own track. Review the [Blue Button track agenda](https://confluence.hl7.org/spaces/FHIR/pages/324975125/2025+-+07+Blue+Button+2.0).

We hope to see you there!
