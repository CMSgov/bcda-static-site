BCDA is inviting existing users to join the Version 3 (v3) pilot. This is a chance to get started with v3 before its rollout, and give feedback to help shape the API.

## What pilot participants will do

Every two weeks you’ll be asked to complete one of five brief test scenarios and attend BCDA Office Hours (via Zoom). Join the live discussions with the BCDA team and a FHIR specialist to receive personalized support and provide our team with feedback on BCDA v3 and the most recent test scenario. For those unable to join us live, we'll provide a short email survey so you can let us know how we're doing. 

## Who can participate? 

We welcome participants to the pilot who are actively engaged with BCDA in their daily work or who can provide insights into how BCDA is leveraged to achieve their organization's goals.

## What’s new in v3

- More timely updates to patient, coverage, and adjudicated claims data
- Simplified and more reliable data mapping capabilities
- Easier tracking of claims through the adjudication process (ACO REACH only)
- Enhanced filtering capabilities to meet needs of complex data workflows
- Improved conformance with select FHIR Implementation Guides

## Ready to get started?

Contact [bcapi@cms.hhs.gov](mailto:bcapi@cms.hhs.gov) to get started. A member of our team will follow up with next steps.
