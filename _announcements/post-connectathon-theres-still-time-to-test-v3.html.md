On June 16, the BCDA team shared a preview of BCDA Version 3 with Connectathon participants. Using the demonstration sandbox environment, testers gave feedback on:

- BCDA’s alignment with selected implementation guides
- V3’s more conformant approach to publishing CMS-specific terminology
- A new _typeFilter parameter
- The updated representation of partially adjudicated claims using the ExplanationOfBenefit resource

The `/demo` endpoints will remain available in BCDA’s sandbox while we collect feedback and refine the upcoming BCDA V3. If you're interested in trying out these new endpoints and sharing feedback, follow the test scenarios in the recording of the BCDA Connectathon track.
