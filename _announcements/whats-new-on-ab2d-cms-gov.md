We’ve rolled out a new design for AB2D.cms.gov. Based on feedback, user research, and testing, the new site:

Makes it easier to find documentation and access claims data
Clearly outlines the process to obtain production access
Provides helpful context on use cases for Medicare Parts A and B claims data
Offers sample and explanatory information to learn about AB2D claims data

## How do I use the new website?

The new site offers 5 main pages (as shown on the navigation menu) and links to additional resources:

## [About]({{ '/assets/uswds/img/icon-dot-gov.svg' | relative_url }})
A new page which describes the AB2D API including its history and permitted uses.

## [API Documentation]({{ '/api-documentation.html' | relative_url }})

Read technical instructions on how to access bearer tokens, test data, production data, and parameters. Access our open-source code repo on GitHub. 

In addition to new documentation, we’ve consolidated information previously provided on our AB2D’s documentation GitHub onto this page.

## [AB2D Data](#) (formerly Understanding AB2D Data)

Get a better understanding of claims data with the Data Dictionary. This resource offers more than 100 categories of data, AB2D sample files, and JSON resources.

## Production Access (formerly Accessing Claims Data)

Learn how to get production access. Our onboarding steps include identifying an Attestor to sign agreements and designating a technical point of contact. During this process, you’ll need to verify the ability to retrieve test data in our sandbox.
